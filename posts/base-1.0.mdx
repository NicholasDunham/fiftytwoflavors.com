This base recipe, which is adapted from the Underbelly [Standard
Base](https://under-belly.org/basic-ice-cream-recipe-examples/) and
[Technique](https://under-belly.org/ice-cream-technique/), has a clean flavor
and a light mouthfeel, and is especially suitable for bright flavors like fruits
and herbs. It's emulsified using two eggs, which is enough to give it a smooth
texture without making it taste eggy.

The base is cooked sous vide at 160°F (71°C) for one hour—hot enough to
pasteurize and thicken the egg yolks, but not so hot that the milk takes on a
cooked flavor. However, because of the low cooking temperature, many popular
stabilizers like xanthan gum and locust bean gum don't work well with this
recipe. Instead, I use a combination of <CMC />, guar gum, and lambda
carrageenan. You can omit the stabillizers if you like, but the texture will be
slightly less smooth. If you prefer to use a different combination of
stabilizers, you may need to adjust the cooking temperature.

  <Section heading="Procedure">
    1. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk to combine. This prevents
       the stabilizers from clumping when added to the liquid ingredients.
    2. Combine the wet ingredients, except the egg yolks, in a blender. With the
       blender running just fast enough to create a vortex without splashing, 
       add the dry ingredients. Put the lid on the blender and blend at the
       highest speed for about thirty seconds.
    3. Add the egg yolks and blend for another thirty seconds.
    4. Transfer the mixture to a resealable bag and cook using a sous vide
       circulator at 160°F/71°C for one hour.
    5. Transfer the mixture back to the blender and blend at the highest speed
       for one minute. Then put the mixture back in the resealable bag and chill
       completely in an ice bath.
    6. Let the mixture rest in the refrigerator for at least four hours, or
       overnight, before churning in an ice cream machine.
